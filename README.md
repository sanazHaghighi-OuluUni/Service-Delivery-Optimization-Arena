Service Process Optimization and Queue Simulation
Research Project - Social Security Organization Case Study

Project Overview This project addresses operational bottlenecks and long waiting times at a large-scale Social Security Organization. Using Arena 14.0 Simulation software, I developed a digital twin of the service flow to test and validate efficiency-driven improvements.




Optimization Scenarios and Results I designed and simulated 3 strategic scenarios to transform the service delivery model:


Scenario 1 (Information Desk Integration): Streamlined customer flow by introducing a specialized guidance unit to reduce confusion.



Scenario 2 (Process Automation): Simulated the transition from physical paper files to a digital database, eliminating manual retrieval delays.



Scenario 3 (Resource Re-allocation): Optimized staffing levels in high-traffic administrative units based on workload distribution.


Key Impact:


Validation: The simulation model achieved over 90% accuracy compared to real-world operational data.


Efficiency: Identified a 10.83% reduction in average waiting time and a significant decrease in total Time in System for customers.
